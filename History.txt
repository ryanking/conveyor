== 0.2.3 / 2008-10-21
* update channel reading code for base-36
* adding logging to the server startup process
* new 2-level indexing scheme. only %10 of index items are held in memory 
   * 10x reduction in memory useage
   * 1000x speedup in startup time
* added rack dependency
* index rebuilding script
* time the startup
* some performance improvements for index loading
* initial block caching strategy for lookups by id
* cache rejecting + dealing with an edge case on nearest_after
* refuse to open an index that isn't in sequential id order
* log http response code when channel already exists

== 0.2.2 / 2008-04-10
* make sure that an empty channel still has @last_id set
* switch back to mongrel. too many problems with event machine on solaris
* add logging for 404s. should probably switch this to a rack middleware
* adding a verbose mode, that dumps debug output to stdout

== 0.2.1 / 2008-02-29
* added get by timestamp and rewind to timestamp (for groups, too)

== 0.2.0 / 2008-02-26

* switched from using Mongrel to Thin. this adds a dependency on thin, which depends on Event Machine
* GZIPed storage. Entries over an arbitrary size (>=256 bytes) are compressed before written down. Since this constitutes a change in file format, the script conveyor-upgrade should be run on all date before running the new version.
* Channels can now be deleted. This is very unsafe and only available when running with the --unsafe switch.
* Channels are auto-created the first time you try and post a message to them.
* Only channels with valid names are opened by the server.
* The client API was refactored to be more like the Channel API and Channel-specific.

== 0.1.4 / 2008-02-19
* support for getting multiple items at once
* rewinding implemented for group iterators

== 0.1.2 / 2008-02-05
* various bugfixes

== 0.1.1 / 2008-01-31
